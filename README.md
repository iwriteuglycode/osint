If you have landed here, I would turn back before it is too late. You will find code that is not efficient, gibberish-looking, shamelessy copied from stack overflow and the modded with bondo and a spoiler I bought from K-Mart, and appears as if it fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down (including others' code branches). However, just like the Millenium Falcon, it may not be much to look at but it should have it where it counts. Enjoy the shameless plagiarism, and contemplate its Codex Gigas-like inscrutability.
